 ## what is Docher ?! :whale:
 
    -Docker is software that allows users to run lightweight virtual machines. You can build Docker "containers" with a Dockerfile.
    -A container is a single lightweight virtual machine running an os, with its own memory space and storage. 
    -It is created on an image, which is a template with preconfigured software. 
    -A container differs from a virtual machine because it uses the same kernel as the host computer, whereas a virtual machine has its own kernel. 
    -Containers are faster and lighter.

## what is Dockerfile ?! :scroll:	

     -A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. 
     Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.
